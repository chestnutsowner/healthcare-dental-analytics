# HealthCare Dental Utilization – Automation, SQL & Testing (Portfolio Documentation)

This repository is a **documentation-first portfolio project** showing end-to-end thinking as a junior systems/data analyst:

1. **Automation (Python + Selenium)**  
   Automate downloading the latest *Dental FFS and DMC Performance Fact Sheet* from the California DHCS website.

2. **SQL & BigQuery Analysis**  
   Clean, split, join, and analyze Medi-Cal dental utilization data by county and age group in BigQuery, focusing on Los Angeles and San Diego.

3. **Testing Framework (Python + BigQuery)**  
   Define a simple Python script and manual test cases to validate visualization of Annual Dental Visits for Ages 10–44, including error handling for bad inputs.

> This repo is intentionally **documentation + screenshots only** – it’s a *proof of knowledge* and process, not a runnable production system.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Web automation:** Selenium WebDriver, download handling, DOM interaction.
- **Cloud analytics:** BigQuery SQL for cleaning, transforming, and aggregating a large public dataset.
- **Data modeling:** Splitting a multi-year dataset into time windows, joining and aggregating by county and age.
- **Testing mindset:** Defining explicit test cases (happy path + error cases) for a data visualization script.
- **Documentation:** Writing objective, business purpose, and technical steps in a structured, stakeholder-friendly way.
